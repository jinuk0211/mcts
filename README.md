Question: △ABC的两内角平分线OB、OC相交于点O，若∠A＝110°，则∠BOC＝（）
Choices:
(A) 135°
(B) 140°
(C) 145°
(D) 150°
existing step:
Image Description: Triangle ABC with angle AAC labeled as 110 degrees. The angle bisectors of angles B and angle C intersect at point O.
Step 2: Calculate the measure of ∠BOC using the properties of angle bisectors and the sum of angles in a triangle.

Since ∠A = 110°, the sum of the other remaining two angles, ∠B + ∠C, must equal 77
Step 3: Calculate the measures of ∠B and ∠C using the property remaining two angles, ∠B + ∠c, must equal
Step 4: Calculate the measures of ∠B and ∠C using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle equals 180°.

1. Identify all large rubber spheres in the image:
   - There is one large green sphere that appears to be made of rubber.

2. Subtract this large rubber sphere from the total number of objects:
   - Total objects before subtraction: 6 (green sphere, purple cylinder, yellow cylinder, gray metallic cube, yellow cube, small purple sphere)
   - After subtracting the green sphere: 6 - 1 = 5

3. Identify all big shiny cylinders in the image:
   - There is one large shiny yellow cylinder.

4. Subtract this large shiny
